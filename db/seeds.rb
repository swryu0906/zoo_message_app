Video from the scene in Kerala shows the six-year-old elephant at the bottom of the well in water almost up to its trunk.

The forest workers brought in a backhoe to dig out the well. As it neared the bottom, the little elephant appeared to try to help by using its trunk to dig the dirt.

Eventually, after five hours of digging by rescuers, the elephant was able to climb out and escape, according to Reuters.

ANI News reports that the elephant suffered minor injuries.")

We aren't sure what you were thinking when you made baby elephants. Were you aware their ears and trunk would flop everywhere comically, or did that just happen by chance and you decided to roll with it? How did you fit so much cute into one clumsy little creature? Regardless, we just wanted to drop you a line to say thank you, and keep up the good work.

In honor of the animal, here's two straight minutes of baby elephants doing what they do best: Stealing our hearts, one awkward step at a time.")

The cubs have developed more white fuzz over their bodies, while their black markings and thicker fur is also starting to come in. And the cubs are developing thumb pads on their paws which will help them hold bamboo when they are older.

The smaller panda of the two is now 20 centimetres long and weighs 422 grams. The larger cub is 23 centimetres and weighs 672 grams.

Er Shun is one of two pandas on loan to the zoo from China. Along with the cubs, she has been under constant observation by experts from Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding in China since their birth.

The zoo says she continues to be a great mother to the cubs.")
